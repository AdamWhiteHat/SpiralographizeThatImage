# Spiralographize That Image


This project was inspired by a 17th century engraving by Claude Mellan depicting Jesus Christ wearing a crown of thorns called "With a Thread".
The print is really just a single line--a spiral--of varying thickness.

This is a winforms application that prompts for a input image file when ran. It wants a grayscale image. I find a 600x600 image seems to work best, although any image size can be selected.
